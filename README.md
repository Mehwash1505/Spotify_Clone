# Spotify Web Player Clone

## Project Description

This project is a front-end clone of the Spotify Web Player interface. It replicates the primary layout and visual styling of the desktop application using HTML5 and CSS3. The application focuses on responsive design principles and structural accuracy, featuring a navigation sidebar, a main content browsing area, and a persistent music player bar.

## Features

### Core Layout
* **Sidebar Navigation:** A fixed-position sidebar containing the main navigation links (Home, Search) and a user library section.
* **Main Content Area:** A central, scrollable view displaying music categories, recently played tracks, and featured charts using a card-based grid layout.
* **Music Player:** A fixed bottom bar that persists across the application, containing playback controls, track information, and a progress slider.

### Visual Styling
* **Responsive Design:** The interface adapts to smaller screen sizes (max-width: 1000px) by selectively hiding secondary elements and adjusting layout proportions.
* **Flexbox Architecture:** Utilizes CSS Flexbox for alignment and distribution of space within the sidebar, navigation headers, and player controls.
* **Interactive States:** Includes opacity changes and hover effects on navigation items, buttons, and icons to provide user feedback.
* **Typography:** Implements the Montserrat font family to match the original application's typography.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup for the document structure.
* **CSS3:** Styling, layout management, and media queries.
* **Font Awesome:** External library for interface icons.
* **Google Fonts:** Source for the Montserrat font family.
* **Material Symbols:** Google Material Symbols for specific UI icons.

## File Structure

* `Project1.html`: The main entry point containing the HTML structure.
* `Project1.css`: The stylesheet defining the visual appearance and layout rules.
* `assets/`: (Implied) Directory containing image resources such as `logo.png`, `card1img.jpeg`, and `player_icon1.png`.

## Installation and Usage

1.  Download the project files to your local machine.
2.  Ensure the HTML and CSS files are located in the same directory as the image assets.
3.  Open `Project1.html` in any modern web browser to view the interface.
